YARD2 LIRC driver README
========================

This directory holds a complete lirc driver for yard2. It requires
lirc >= 0.9.4. If you are using a packaged version you probably need to
have the -devel and -doc packages installed.

To build and install the driver together with the support files:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Verifying the driver after make install:

     $ lirc-lsplugins -q yard2
     ---   /usr/lib64/lirc/plugins/yard2.so

You could also find the driver docs in the manual. The path varies, but
in a packaged version typically /usr/share/doc/lirc/lirc.org/html/index.html.
