lirc (0.9.4~alpha-1.1) experimental; urgency=medium

   The 0.9.4 configuration needs to be manually updated.

   lirc 0.9.0 had a generic service called 'lirc'. The 0.9.4 package has
   three separate services lircd.service, irexec.service and lircmd.service.
   These must be manually configured after installation. A script
   /usr/share/lirc/lirc-old2new is available. Instructions are available
   at /usr/share/doc/lirc/README.debian

   Users are strongly advised to check the /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
   and also systemd status after upgrade using:
     - cat /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
     - systemctl status lircd.service
     - systemctl status lircmd.service
     - systemctl status irexec.service

   The /etc/lirc/hardware.conf file is no longer supported.

   As shipped, lircd is configured to use the devinput driver and the
   'auto' device. This should be a working configuration if:
     - The capture device is supported by the kernel.
     - The remote is supported by the kernel.
     - There is exactly one capture device (i. e., /sys/class/rc/ entry).
     - There is no need to send (i. e., to do IR blasting).
   Bottom line: lircd has a limited but sometimes working setup as shipped.
