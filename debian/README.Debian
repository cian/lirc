lirc 0.9.3 for Debian
---------------------

This package is a first attempt to package the more recent upstream. It
makes no attempt, none, to keep compatibility with previous version. To
use it, it must be re-configured using the new, upstream config
mechanisms as described in the Configuration Guide in the manual.
