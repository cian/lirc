.SH NAME
.P
lircd-uinput \- Forward lirc button presses as uinput events

.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
lircd-uinput [\fIoptions\fR]... [\fIlircd output socket\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Enables automatic generation of Linux input events. \fBlircd-uinput\fR
opens the uinput device and injects key events received on a
\fBlircd (8)\fR output socket to the Linux kernel.
The key code depends on the name that was given a button in the
lircd config file, e.g., if the button is named KEY_1, the '1'
key code will be generated.
A complete list of possible button names  is available in
\fI/usr/include/linux/input.hi\fR and also using \fIirrecord -l\fR.
.P
.B lircd-uinput
is designed to run as a systemd service.
.P
The \fIlircd output socket\fR argument is an optional path to lircd output socket.
It defaults to the \fIoutput\fR value in the [lircd] section of the
lirc_options config file, falling back to \fI@varrundir@/lirc/lircd\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP

the legal namespace as defined by \fIirrecord(1)\fR, i. e., as defined
by the kernel.
