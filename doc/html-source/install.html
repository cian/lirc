     <!-- Dependencies +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
    <p>
    This chapter describes how to build and install LIRC. Note that LIRC
    is packaged for all major linux distributions. If you
    just want to use lirc, you should be able to install it like any
    other package. This way, you don't have to look at the
    dependencies, build and installation description found here.</p>
    <p>
    The ./configure script is the ultimate source as to what libraries
    and tools LIRC requires. The list here is not complete in any way,
    being focused on things to install before building.</p>

    <A NAME="dependencies"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Dependencies</H1>

    <p>
      <b>Mandatory dependencies</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few mandatory dependencies, all of which
      packaged on most (all?) Linux distributions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Building directly from the git source tree requires
          <em>autoconf</em>,<em>automake</em> and
          <em>libtool</em>>.</li>
      <li>Compilation and linking requires the GNU toolchain
          including <em>make</em>, <em>gcc</em>, <em>g++</em>
          and <em>ld</em>.</li>
      <li>The build requires python3. If the installed package does
          not provide a python3 link (e. g., just python3.3)
          the <em>--enable-python3-fix</em>  installs a
          wrapper.</li>
      <li>Building without kernel headers is not tested, and might
          cause all sorts of problems. </li>
      <li>xsltproc </li>
     </ul>
     <p><b>Optional dependencies</b></p>
     If these are missing, ./configure can cope with it and still
     build LIRC in a more or less limited way.
     <ul>
      <li>Several scripts need the python3 PyYaml package at
          http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML. Building without
          this is possible but not recommended.</li>
      <li>Generating the HTML manpages requires man2html. </li>
      <li>Generating the API documentation requires Doxygen. </li>
      <li>The <em>lirc-setup</em> GUI configuration tool
          needs python3-gi and thus also the Gtk
          libs. These are not required for the build, though. </li>
      <li>Building the X11 GUI tools like <em>irxevent</em> and
          <em>xmode2</em> requires the X11 header files. </li>
      <li> The audio drivers needs the alsa and portaudio libs
           (libraries and headers). </li>
       <li>
          The <em>Irman (=UIR)</em> driver requires libirman available at
         <A HREF="http://www.lirc.org/software/snapshots/"><em>libirman</em>
         </A>. To build, the irman library must exist as a dynamic .so module.
         At the time of writing this is true for the Fedora package, but
         not for Debian. You can build and install the library locally
         directly from the sources to walk around problems with the
         packaged version. </li>
       <li>
         The <em>ftdi</em> driver requires libftdi from
         <a href="http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/">
         http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/</a></li>
       <li>
         The <em>iguanair</em> driver requires libiguanair from
         <a href="http://iguanaworks.net/ir">http://iguanaworks.net/ir
         </a></li>
     </ul>

    <A NAME="kernel"></A>
    <hr>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Kernel</H1>

    <P>
      As of 0.9.0+, lirc uses the kernel modules from the
      kernel. Some of these are formerly lirc modules which are
      now part of the kernel. Thus, building lirc does not involve
      building any kernel modules (as it used to).  </P>
    <p>
      Some of the former lirc modules are part of the official kernel
      and should be available on any reasonably updated system. However,
      some are in the staging area; if they are part of your kernel
      depends on the distro you use (unless of course if you compile
      your own kernel).
    <P>
    <P>
      If you want to use a home-brew receiver, an Anir Multimedia
      Magic, a Packard Bell receiver, the IRdeo or if you want to use
      the SIR IrDA driver, I suggest that you use the lirc_serial
      or lirc_sir module.  Usually the serial port driver grabs all
      ports it auto-detects as soon as it is loaded and the LIRC
      modules won't be able to use any of them.
    </P>
    <P>
      There are two solutions for this problem. Either you load the
      LIRC module before the kernel serial port driver is loaded
      (that's why you have to compile it as a module) or you call
      <em>setserial /dev/ttySx uart none</em> to release the according
      port. setserial usually is already called during boot-up in some
      init script whose location depends on the distribution you
      use.  If you tell setserial to
      configure a port that is already claimed by a LIRC module, the
      kernel serial driver will steal the port from the LIRC module
      and LIRC will stop working. So check your setserial
      configuration to only configure available ports. Debian users
      should adjust their <em>/etc/serial.conf</em>.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>TV cards:</B> To use any remote control receivers connected
      directly to a bttv based TV card you will need a working bttv
      setup in your kernel. For most TV cards we rely on bttv
      autodetection. That way you don't have to give any parameters to
      the module as they are selected internally depending on the
      information the bttv module gives us. This means that you should
      pay attention that your TV card is detected correctly by bttv.
    </P>

    <!-- Supported Hardware ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <A NAME="hardware"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Supported Hardware</H1>
    <HR WIDTH="70%">

    <P>
      Generally speaking everything that can receive or send infrared
      signals can be supported by LIRC. The project began with support
      for home-brew receivers and transmitters for the serial port and
      later support for analogous hardware for the parallel port was
      added. At that time the focus of the project was to provide an
      infrared solution that is both very cheap and easy to
      assemble. The following links point to instructions how to build
      your own receiver/transmitter.

    </UL>

    <P>
      Current versions of LIRC now support many more commercially
      available solutions. Examples are the Irman, built-in IrDA ports
      or TV cards. Drivers for even more hardware are likely to appear
      in the future. If you are a programmer who wants to maintain
      such a driver you are welcome to join the project.
    </P>
    <P>
      There are example and test kernel modules in the drivers/
      directory. None of these are required for regular LIRC use, but
      they are supposed to be helpful while testing or writing drivers.</P>

    <!-- Compiling +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <A NAME="compile"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Compile and Install</H1>

    <P>
      Since 0.9.1+ , lirc loads drivers dynamically. This means that
      that the build system is redesigned to always build all drivers.
      The former setup.sh script is dropped in favor of a standard
      ./configure, make, make install sequence.
    </P>
    <p>
      When building directly from git, a first required step to
      create ./configure and some other files is </p>
<pre>
           ./autogen.sh
</pre>
      Whether using git sources or just using a distributed tarball, the
      next steps are the canonical
<pre>
            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install
</pre>
    Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        When running the configure script, please pay attention at its
        output.  Specifically, at the very end it prints a list of
        the enabled functionality.</li>
      <li>
        Running configure without options will install lirc in /usr/local
        according to GNU standards. However, many examples in this manual
        as well as other documentation are assuming that ./configure ran
        with the <em>--prefix=/usr</em> option, installing in /etc/lirc,
        /usr/bin etc.</li>
      <li>
        The build system supports VPATH builds which does not
        clutter the source tree. To use this do something like:
<pre>
            mkdir _build; cd _build;
            ../configure
            make
            sudo make install
</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <A NAME="check"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Checking the build</H1>

     Since the dynamic drivers are not linked during the build, it's
     recommended to check that the expected drivers are built and can
     be loaded using
<pre>
             cd tools; ./lirc-lsplugins -U ../plugins/.libs
</pre>
     <p>
     This will create a list of the all drivers available, and also
     possible link errors not revealed during the build.
     <em>lirc-lsplugins</em> has a -h option providing help, and
     <em> nroff -man ../doc/man/lirc-lsplugins.1 | more </em>
     provides more complete info.</p>
     <!-- Install LIRC ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <A NAME="configuration"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Configuration</H1>

    <p>
      Formerly, lirc was configured during build where the setup.sh script
      was used to select driver, configuration file, etc. Also, there was
      little support for starting and running the services from boot. From
      0.9.1+ the configuration is instead done after the build. The
      configuration steps for the main lircd program involves:
    <ul>
        <li> In some cases e. g., serial devices setting up kernel module
             options in /etc/modprobe.d. </li>
        <li> Selecting the driver and kernel device for your capture
             device.</li>
        <li> Selecting configuration file for your remote.</li>
        <li> Configuring and using systemd to run the services. </li>
        <li> Creating lircrc files for your applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is described in the <a href="configuration-guide.html">
      configuration guide</a>.</p>

    <p>
     The <a href="NEWS.txt">NEWS</a> file  describes the changes since last
     version. Normally, upgrading from a previous version should not be too
     painful. However, if you have to update a really old version it's probably
     better to make a fresh install.
