     <!-- Dependencies +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
    <p>
    This chapter describes how to build and install LIRC. Note that LIRC
    is packaged for all major linux distributions. If you
    just want to use lirc, you should be able to install it like any
    other package. This way, you don't have to look at the
    dependencies, build and installation description found here.</p>
    <p>
    The ./configure script is the ultimate source as to what libraries
    and tools LIRC requires. The list here is not complete in any way,
    being focused on things to install before building.</p>

    <A NAME="dependencies"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Dependencies</H1>

    <P>
      First, lirc is packaged for all major linux distributions. If you
      just want to use lirc, you should be able to install it like any
      other package. This way, you don't have to look at the
      dependencies, build and installation description found here.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few mandatory dependencies, all of which
      packaged on most (all?) Linux distributions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Building directly from the git source tree requires
          <em>autoconf</em>,<em>automake</em> and
          <em>libtool</em>>.</li>
      <li>Compilation and linking requires the GNU toolchain
          including <em>make</em>, <em>gcc</em>, <em>g++</em>
          and <em>ld</em>.</li>
      <li>The build requires python3. If the installed package does
          not provide a python3 link (e. g., just python3.3)
          the <em>--enable-python3-fix</em>  installs a
          wrapper.</li>
      <li>Building without kernel headers is not tested, and might
          cause all sorts of problems. </li>
      <li>xsltproc </li>
     </ul>
     <p><b>Optional dependencies</b></p>
     If these are missing, ./configure can cope with it and still
     build LIRC in a more or less limited way.
     <ul>
      <li>Several scripts need the python3 PyYaml package at
          http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML.</li>
      <li>Overall, python3 is.required for the build </li>
      <li>The build also needs man2html (although it adjusts without it)
          and xsltproc. </li>
      <li>The configuration script needs python3-gi and thus also the Gtk
          libs. Theese are not required for the build, though. </li>.
    </ul>

    <P>
      If you want to compile and use all tools, you also need an
      installed version of the  X11 header files (needed by
      <em>irxevent</em> and <em>xmode2</em>) The configure script
      will notify you if some necessary files are missing and the
      according tools won't be compiled.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>Irman (=UIR) :</B> To use your Irman with LIRC you need the
      latest <A HREF="http://www.lirc.org/software/snapshots/">
      <em>libirman</em></A> library. At the time this has been written
      the current libirman version was 0.4.3.  To build, the irman
      library must exist as a dynamic .so module. At the time of writing
      this is true for the Fedora package, but not for Debian. configure
      checks for the library, and won't build the irman driver without
      it.
   </P>

    <A NAME="kernel"></A>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Kernel</H1>

    <P>
      As of 0.9.0+, lirc uses the kernel modules from the
      kernel. Some of these are formerly lirc modules which are
      now part of the kernel. Thus, building lirc does not involve
      building any kernel modules (as it used to).  </P>
    <p>
      Some of the former lirc modules are part of the official kernel
      and should be available on any reasonably updated system. However,
      some are in the staging area; if they are part of your kernel
      depends on the distro you use (unless of course if you compile
      your own kernel).  </P>
    <P>
      There are example and test kernel modules in the drivers/
      directory. None of these are required for regular LIRC use, but
      they are supposed to be helpful while testing or writing drivers.</P>
    <P>
      If you want to use a home-brew receiver, an Anir Multimedia
      Magic, a Packard Bell receiver, the IRdeo or if you want to use
      the SIR IrDA driver, I suggest that you use the lirc_serial
      or lirc_sir kernel module. </p>
    <P>
      <B>TV cards:</B> To use any remote control receivers connected
      directly to a bttv based TV card you will need a working bttv
      setup in your kernel. For most TV cards we rely on bttv
      autodetection. That way you don't have to give any parameters to
      the module as they are selected internally depending on the
      information the bttv module gives us. This means that you should
      pay attention that your TV card is detected correctly by bttv.
    </P>

    <!-- Compiling +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <A NAME="compile"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Compile and Install</H1>

    <P>
      Since 0.9.1+ , lirc loads drivers dynamically. This means that
      that the build system is redesigned to always build all drivers.
      The former setup.sh script is dropped in favor of a standard
      ./configure, make, make install sequence.
    </P>
    <P>
      When running the configure script, please pay attention at its
      output.  Specifically, at the very end it prints a list of
      the enabled functionality. After having configured the package just type
     <em>make</em>.
    </P>

    <P>
      <B>Note:</B> You won't find a configure script in the source repo
      version of LIRC. You will have to generate it first by executing
      <em>./autogen.sh</em>.
    </P>
    <P>
      Installing the compiled programs is really easy, just type
      <em>sudo make install</em>. All binaries  and  configuration
      files should be copied to their proper destinations.
    </P>

    <A NAME="configuration"></A><HR>
    <H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Configuration</H1>

    <p>
      Formerly, lirc was configured during build where the setup.sh script
      was used to select driver, configuration file, etc. Also, there was
      little support for starting and running the services from boot. From
      0.9.1+ the configuration is instead done after the build. The
      configuration steps for the main lircd program involves:
    <ul>
        <li> Selecting the driver and device for your capture device.</li>
        <li> Selecting configuration file for your remote.</li>
        <li> In some cases e. g., serial devices setting up kernel module
             options in /etc/modprobe.d. </li>
        <li> Selecting the driver and kernel device for your capture
             device.</li>
        <li> Selecting configuration file for your remote.</li>
        <li> Configuring and using systemd to run the services. </li>
        <li> Creating lircrc files for your applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is described in the <a href="configuration-guide.html">
      configuration guide</a>.

    <p>
     The <a href="NEWS.txt">NEWS</a> file  describes the changes since last
     version. Normally, upgrading from a previous version should not be too
     painful. However, if you have to update a really old version it's probably
     better to make a fresh install.
