                    <P>
                      Usually you don't have to create a config file
                      yourself if you use this driver as this <A
                      HREF="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/devinput/lircd.conf.devinput">generic
                      config file</A> should already contain all
                      existing keys.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                      This driver uses <em>/dev/input/event0</em> as
                      its input device per default. You should provide
                      the correct device as --device parameter on the
                      lircd and irrecord command line.

                      Sometimes the input device mapping changes
                      between system reboots. In that case you are
                      also able to specify the correct input device by
                      its name or physical location by preceding the
                      desired value with <em>name=</em> or
                      <em>phys=</em>. See the Configuration Guide.</p>
